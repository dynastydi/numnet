A simple 3 layer feed-forward neural network built in pure numerical python.

Currently, the network is defined by 32 lines of code.

Comes with a part-pretrained model - move, remove or rename `h_model.npy` and `o_model.npy` to train from scratch. 

The simple terminal command `python3 run_mnist.py` will train and test the network on the included classic MNIST dataset, but the numnet itself can be applied to any data.
